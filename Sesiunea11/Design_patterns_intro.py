Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design.
Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customise to solve a particular
design problem in your code.


They define commune language that helps your team to communicate more efficiently.
Design patterns differ by their complexity, level of detail, and scale of applicability
to the entire system being designed.
