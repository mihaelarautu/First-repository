'''
We need te write tests to ensure that our code works as expected.

A unit test is a way of testing a unit
                                - the smallest piece off code that can be logically isolated in a system.
                                (a function, a method, or property)

Tests should be separated from the actual code in a folder called ''tests''.

Each test file should be named "test_<file_name>", where file_name is the name of the file that is tested.

Each test function or class, should begin with "test_" or "Test"(for classes)
